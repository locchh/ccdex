## Deep Dive

### 1. GSD (SDD)
- **Philosophy**: Anti-enterprise. Built by a solo dev for solo devs. Solves *context rot* — the degradation as Claude's context window fills up.
- **How it works**: You describe your idea → GSD extracts full requirements → creates roadmap → phases → atomic task plans → executes in fresh sub-contexts. Each plan is small enough to run in a clean window.
- **Unique strengths**: Context window management (the core differentiator), parallel sub-agent execution, model profile switching (quality/balanced/budget), security hardening, backlog management.
- **Weakness**: Opinionated workflow — not designed for large teams or complex enterprise org structures.

### 2. BMAD-METHOD (Methodology + SDD)
- **Philosophy**: "AI-driven Agile." Structured like a real software team — you work *with* specialist agents (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, Scrum Master…) not just one chat-bot.
- **How it works**: You go through full agile lifecycle — brainstorm → PRD → architecture → stories → dev loop. "Party Mode" lets you bring multiple agent personas into one session.
- **Unique strengths**: Scale-adaptive (adjusts depth based on project complexity), modular ecosystem (game dev, testing, creative intelligence modules), the most comprehensive lifecycle coverage, 34+ workflows, completely free.
- **Weakness**: Heavy. Most complex of the four. Overkill for solo indie projects or quick features.

### 3. Spec Kit (SDD)
- **Philosophy**: "Specs become executable." Flip the traditional approach — spec first, code second. Backed by GitHub itself.
- **How it works**: `constitution` → `specify` → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement`. Each step is a CLI command that creates structured documents. Strong emphasis on *clarification before planning* to reduce rework.
- **Unique strengths**: GitHub-backed credibility, Python-based CLI (`uv`), supports the widest range of AI agents (Copilot, Kiro, Amp, Qoder, etc.), excellent brownfield/existing codebase support, `presets` and `extensions` for customization.
- **Weakness**: More manual/collaborative — doesn't do as much automatic orchestration. Requires more active steering from the developer.

### 4. Agent OS (SDD)
- **Philosophy**: Solve the root cause of why agents produce inconsistent code — **they don't know your standards**. The narrowest scope of the four.
- **How it works**: `discover-standards` → extract patterns from your existing codebase → `deploy-standards` → intelligently inject relevant standards into agent context based on what you're building. Plus `shape-spec` for better planning.
- **Unique strengths**: Laser-focused on the standards problem. Works *alongside* other tools (you could use Agent OS + GSD or Agent OS + Spec Kit together). Extremely lightweight.
- **Weakness**: Not a full development workflow — it's a complement, not a replacement. No lifecycle management, no phased execution.

## Key Differentiators

| Concern | Best Tool |
|---|---|
| Context rot / long sessions | **GSD** |
| Team collaboration, full agile | **BMAD** |
| Spec quality & clarification | **Spec Kit** |
| Agent consistency with your codebase | **Agent OS** |
| Widest AI platform support | **Spec Kit** |
| Least overhead for solo devs | **GSD** or **Agent OS** |
| Most customizable | **BMAD** (module ecosystem) |

## How They Relate to Each Other

They solve adjacent but distinct problems and are **not direct competitors**. A reasonable stack could be:

> **Agent OS** (discover your standards) + **GSD** (execute phases reliably) + **Spec Kit** (write quality specs before starting)

GSD's author explicitly mentions Spec Kit and BMAD as "more complicated than needed." BMAD is the most mature/comprehensive. Spec Kit is the most GitHub-ecosystem-native. Agent OS is the most focused utility.
